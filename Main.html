<p>Holy Paladins specialize in very strong single-target healing, being
one of the few healers that can truly impact whether a single player will
live or die at any given moment. They also possess several tools that 
help them mitigate or avoid damage, both on themselves and on other raid 
embers, such as @@@WoWBlessingofProtection@@@ and @@@WoWDevotionAura@@@. 
With so much utility, they are consistently one of the strongest specs in
every form of content and have been that way for years.</p>

<p>Heading into @@@LinkTheWarWithin@@@, @@@WoWHolyShock@@@ feels like a very powerful
ability. Many talents were also added to increase the power of casting in order 
to give players desiring a casting playstyle stronger options to increase their output.
That being said, Holy Power spenders have also had their power increased, making
builds that consistently use @@@WoWCrusaderStrike@@@ much more powerful as well.
Overall, there are many different ways to play Holy Paladin, including the introduction
of Hero Talents and the changes that come with a new expansion. If you want to cast, 
there are plenty of options, and if you prefer a melee playstyle, then you also have talents 
amplifying that playstyle. The talent tree has everything you could hope for and then some.</p>

<p>In order to properly play a healing role, you will need more than just
class-specific information. To better understand healing in general, we
recommend that you read our <a href="@@@PathWoWHealing@@@">healing
guide</a>.</p>

<h1>@@@SpecSpec@@@ @@@SpecClass@@@ Patch 11.0.5 Changes</h1>

<p>Paladin as a whole has received some major changes heading into
Patch 11.0.5. The class tree specifically has been reworked with many
new talent choices added, and many old ones removed. Overall, the changes
aren't positive or negative, they primarily just add extra niche utility
to the class tree that won't overly impact any form of content. It is recommended
that you visit the talent page to get a look at the new talent tree and how
you should aim to build it!</p>

<h1>@@@SpecSpec@@@ @@@SpecClass@@@ and Guide Changes for @@@LinkCurrentExpansion@@@</h1>

<p>@@@SpecSpec@@@ @@@SpecClass@@@ has received some changes that will
significantly alter how the spec plays in The War Within. The most
notable changes will be listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>@@@WoWGlimmerofLight@@@ &mdash; Removed from the game.</li>
<li>@@@WoWDaybreak@@@ &mdash; Removed from the game.</li>
<li>@@@WoWRisingSunlight@@@ &mdash; After casting @@@WoWAvengingWrath@@@
or @@@WoWDivineToll@@@, your next 2 @@@WoWHolyShock@@@s will cast
2 additional times.</li>
</ul>

<p>Along with these changes, Holy Paladin received significant aura buffs
as well as buffs to @@@WoWWordofGlory@@@ and @@@WoWHolyShock@@@. This has
resulted in a playstyle where consuming @@@WoWInfusionofLight@@@ has become
significantly less important. The main gameplay will consist of pressing
@@@WoWHolyShock@@@ as much as possible and spending Holy Power as often
as possible. When neither is possible, you will aim to drop @@@WoWConsecration@@@
as a Herald of the Sun Holy Paladin in order to buff @@@WoWEternalFlame@@@
through @@@WoWStrengthofConviction@@@. Otherwise, you will then proceed
to consume @@@WoWInfusionofLight@@@ with @@@WoWHolyLight@@@ or @@@WoWFlashofLight@@@ when healing
is needed, or @@@WoWJudgmentHoly@@@ when no major healing is necessary.</p>

<h1>Leveling a Holy Paladin</h1>

<p>If you want to play a Holy Paladin but currently do not have one at
max level, you can check out our leveling guide for tips on your journey.</p>

<div class="centered">
@@@ButtonLinkLeveling@@@
</div>

<p>Once you reach the max level, it can be somewhat overwhelming to completely
change the way you play by suddenly implementing a large number of addons in a
short space of time, especially if they have a heavy visual impact on your UI.
We recommend using some of the more basic addons recommended on our Addons page
below while leveling so that you have more time to get used to them during the
easier phases of playing your class.</p>

<p>Having a not only comfortable but solid UI is incredibly important,
especially once you hit max level. To prevent yourself from being overwhelmed
by all the choices, we recommend starting with some basic addons while you are
going through the leveling process. This will help you get accustomed to the
different addons while the class is still in a relatively easier phase.</p>

<h1>Basics of Holy Paladin Gameplay</h1>

<p>Holy Paladin, like any healer, is all about using your abilities
strategically. Rather than a fixed rotation, you will be using your flexible
spell kit to adapt and overcome whatever the game throws at you.</p>

<p>In order to be a successful Holy Paladin, you must make use of your
cooldown abilities as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>If you are an absolute beginner to the spec but would like to learn the 
fundamentals of the class, I recommend looking through the <a href="@@@PathWoWPaladinHolySpells@@@">Spell Summary</a>

<h1>Holy Paladin in @@@LinkCurrentExpansion@@@</h1>

<p>Even with the introduction of a new talent system, Holy Paladin remains
a top healer choice for any form of content. Holy Paladin will continue to
bring extremely high damage, unique utility, an immunity, and very strong
single-target healing. In many cases, these strengths that have existed for
multiple expansions at this point are only amplified by new talents in
Dragonflight and now The War Within. @@@WoWHolyShock@@@ has received
many talents to increase its power and have the ability to feel as strong as ever.
Regardless of whether you prefer Mythic+, Arena, or even raiding, Holy Paladin
will be one of the strongest healers.</p>

<h1>Holy Paladin End-Game</h1>

<p>There are three main forms of end-game content. Raiding, Mythic+, and PvP.
In each of them, the class plays slightly differently. In order to perform as
well as possible for your preferred form of content, we recommend reading one
of our dedicated pages, which you can find below.</p>
